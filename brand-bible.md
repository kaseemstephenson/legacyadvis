# LEGACY ADVISORS: BRAND BIBLE & CONTEXT

## 1. CORE IDENTITY
**Who we are:** A Founder-First M&A Advisory Firm.
[cite_start]**The Shift:** Moving from "Credible Boutique" to "Category-Defining Authority"[cite: 7].
[cite_start]**The Hook:** "Legacy Advisors owns the intersection of experience and empathy." [cite: 14]
**The Competitor Gap:** Most firms sound like banks (impersonal, corporate). [cite_start]We sound like Founders (empathetic, experienced, "lived experience"). [cite: 5, 51]

## 2. THE "TRUST" FRAMEWORK (Copywriting Logic)
*Use this framework when writing content for any section. [cite_start]Do not use generic Lorem Ipsum.* [cite: 17]

* **T - Name Their Pain (Trouble):** Start where it hurts. [cite_start]Articulate the confusion/fear of selling a business better than they can. [cite: 19, 21]
* **R - Make Them Feel Seen (Relate):** Connection builds credibility. [cite_start]We are operators who have lived the deal. [cite: 22, 24]
* **U - Give Them Language (Uncover):** Name the barriers. [cite_start]Define their "readiness" gap. [cite: 26, 28]
* [cite_start]**S - Change Their Lens (Shift):** It's not "selling out"; it's "scaling your legacy." [cite: 30, 32]
* **T - Show Receipts (Transmit):** Proof meets participation. [cite_start]Trust is earned through evidence and outcomes. [cite: 34, 36]

## 3. VISUAL IDENTITY SYSTEM

### The Symbol: The Infinity Loop
* [cite_start]**Meaning:** Represents continuity, partnership, and the dual nature of an exit (an ending and a beginning)[cite: 64, 66].
* **Usage:** Use as a subtle background element (opacity 5-10%), a loading animation, or a divider.

### Color Palette (Strict Implementation)
* [cite_start]**Navy (#121c29):** Represents "Quiet Power," trust, and intelligence[cite: 75, 92]. Use for primary backgrounds and headers.
* [cite_start]**Legacy Gold (#ecc35a):** Represents value, prestige, and legacy[cite: 76]. Use for buttons, accents, and active states.
* **Off-White (#fdfcf9):** Represents paper/classic finance. [cite_start]Use for content backgrounds to avoid stark white harshness[cite: 89].

### Typography
* **Headings:** *Canela* (or serif equivalent). Graceful, high-contrast. [cite_start]Evokes heritage[cite: 82].
* **Body:** Clean Sans-Serif (Inter/DM Sans). Modern, readable.

## 4. TONE OF VOICE
* **Adjectives:** Quiet Power. Measured Intelligence. [cite_start]Discreet Sophistication. [cite: 92]
* **Don'ts:** Do not sound arrogant, aggressive, or overly "salesy."
* **Dos:** Speak in outcomes, not opinions. [cite_start]Be professional yet personal. [cite: 103, 108]

## 5. CONTENT THEMES
* [cite_start]**The Legacy Method:** Our proprietary process (Audit -> Valuation -> Negotiation -> Close)[cite: 99].
* **Failure is the Condiment:** We don't hide scars; we use them as lessons.
* [cite_start]**Receipts:** We deal in hard facts (Years of experience, deal volume)[cite: 36].
